**Notice: Repository Archived**
This repository has been frozen for further development. All historical files, including the academic-paper directory, remain available here for reference. For continued exploration and updates on the Human-AI Collaborative Intelligence (HAC) framework, including the latest X-CII developments, please visit the new repository: [awesome-hac-framework](https://github.com/torisan-unya/awesome-hac-framework).

### **Important Note**
**The papers in this directory are fictional academic artifacts generated via Human-AI collaboration (involving the author and multiple AIs). All components—authors, affiliations, dates, data, results, references, and journal names—are fabricated for illustrative purposes. No real-world empirical claims are made.** This meta-exercise demonstrates the iterative evolution of collaborative frameworks, emphasizing ethical alignment, uncertainty handling (e.g., hallucination detection protocols with semantic entropy baseline, AUROC~0.75-0.85), axiomatic rigor, and fairness diagnostics as per X-CII principles.
This meta-exercise explores "Human-AI Collaborative Intelligence" by demonstrating framework creation through dialogue. It evolves from theoretical foundations (E-CEI) to extensions (X-CII), simulation-based robustness, and axiomatic formalization with synthetic evaluation. For real-world analogs and updates, refer to the new repository [awesome-hac-framework](https://github.com/torisan-unya/awesome-hac-framework).
**Updated as of September 20, 2025 (Version 2.5)**: Further refined structure for enhanced readability; consolidated metrics (e.g., Core X-CII: Human-only ~0.78, AI-only ~0.76, Collab ~0.84); enhanced fairness diagnostics (EOD L_inf median 0.02; calibration gap proxy median 0.40); integrated group-adaptive thresholds (AUROC~0.72: median Relative X-CII 105.2%, win rate 95%; Core ≥0.75 in 100% of runs). Monte Carlo sensitivity (10,000 replicates): median Relative X-CII 108.7% [95% CI: 107.2-110.1%]; 5-95th percentile Relative X-CII 104.3-112.8%. Added axiomatic λ variations and fairness optimizations in "Future Extensions". Ethical alignment: Hallucination detection protocols emphasized throughout.

This directory hosts a series of fictional papers on Human-AI Collaborative Intelligence, spanning theory construction, hypothetical validation, simulation robustness, and synthetic formalization. The framework evolves iteratively, addressing gaps like dynamic metrics, uncertainty handling, ethical integration, domain adaptation, and fairness diagnostics. Community feedback has refined reproducibility, axiomatic rigor, and group-adaptive optimizations. For ongoing refinements, see [awesome-hac-framework](https://github.com/torisan-unya/awesome-hac-framework).
## Framework Evolution Overview
The papers trace the framework's progression in four stages (aligned with E-CEI's model):
- **Stage 1 (Theoretical)**: Introduces E-CEI for synergistic evaluation with trust-weighted metrics (T coefficient), reliability factor (R), and ethical principles. (Cross-ref: Basis for all subsequent stages.)
- **Stage 2 (Extension & Hypothetical)**: Evolves to X-CII with dynamic components (e.g., AIF, RBI) and simulated 12-month validation (Relative X-CII up to ~150%; Core ≥0.75 in 92% of runs). (Cross-ref: Builds on Stage 1; informs Stages 3-4.)
- **Stage 3 (Simulation Validation)**: Applies Monte Carlo (10,000 replicates) for robustness under uncertainty, reporting median Relative X-CII of 112% (5-95th percentile: 104-120%) and sensitivity to shifts (AUROC~0.72-0.85). Includes group-adaptive thresholds and win rates. (Cross-ref: Extends Stage 2; provides data for Stage 4.)
- **Stage 4 (Formalization & Synthetic)**: Defines X-CII axiomatically (Box-Cox average of Q, E, S; λ=0.25) with synthetic Monte Carlo evaluation, showing robustness (median Relative X-CII 108.7% [95% CI: 107.2-110.1%]; Core ≥0.75 in all runs). Integrates fairness diagnostics (EOD L_inf median 0.02; calibration gap proxy median 0.40) and human-anchored S variants. (Cross-ref: Integrates Stages 1-3 with axiomatic rigor.)
This structure bridges conceptual gaps, emphasizing complementarity, safety thresholds, and domain adaptation. **X-CII Core values across stages: Human-only mean ~0.78; AI-only ~0.76; Collab ~0.84 (synthetic estimates).** Sensitivity to domain shifts: Under AUROC=0.72, Relative X-CII drops to 105.2% with 95% win rate vs. baselines. Fairness diagnostics ensure balanced representation (e.g., EOD L_inf <0.05 in 95% of runs).
