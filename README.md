# Awesome HAC Framework

**日本語訳: 人間-AI協働研究体系**

A curated collection of fictional research on Human-AI Collaborative Intelligence (HAC), featuring the Extended Collaborative Intelligence Index (X-CII) framework. This meta-exercise explores synergistic human-AI collaboration through theoretical evolution, simulations, and axiomatic formalization. No real-world empirical claims are made—all content is fabricated for illustrative purposes.

Inspired by Awesome lists, this repository focuses on the iterative development from E-CEI to X-CII, emphasizing quality (Q), efficiency (E), safety (S), with metrics like Monte Carlo simulations (median Relative X-CII 108.7% [95% CI: 107.2-110.1%]) and fairness diagnostics (EOD L_inf median 0.02).

## Important Disclaimer
The papers and simulations here are fictional artifacts generated via human-AI collaboration. They demonstrate framework evolution but make no real-world claims. For real analogs, refer to sources like HAIC (arXiv:2407.19098).

## Legacy Development
This repository evolved from the original [AI-Novel-Prompt-Hybrid](https://github.com/torisan-unya/AI-Novel-Prompt-Hybrid/tree/main/academic-paper) project. The original repository's development has been frozen, but all historical files remain available there for reference, tracing the meta-exercise from novel prompting hybrids to advanced HAC theory.

## Framework Evolution Overview
The framework progresses in four stages (aligned with E-CEI/X-CII models):
- **Stage 1 (Theoretical)**: E-CEI foundations.
- **Stage 2 (Extension)**: X-CII with dynamic components.
- **Stage 3 (Simulation)**: Monte Carlo robustness.
- **Stage 4 (Formalization)**: Axiomatic X-CII with synthetic evaluation.

Core X-CII values: Human-only ~0.78, AI-only ~0.76, Collab ~0.84.
