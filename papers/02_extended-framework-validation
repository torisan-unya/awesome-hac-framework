## Historical Note

This simulated paper extends our previous theoretical framework [Torisan Unya [@torisan_unya], 2025a] with hypothetical empirical scenarios, proposed implementation protocols, and illustrative multi-domain applications. The Extended Collaborative Intelligence Index (X-CII) represents a conceptual evolution from the initial E-CEI framework, demonstrated through simulation, and refined based on real frameworks like HAI Index (Friends of Europe 2025)[21] and PAI Human-AI Collaboration Framework (Medium 2025)[22].

## Abstract

Building upon our theoretical foundation established in 2025, this document presents a simulated extension and hypothetical validation of a framework for Human-AI Collaborative Intelligence. Through an illustrative 12-month scenario involving 200 hypothetical participants across four distinct domains, we demonstrate potential efficacy of a simplified Extended Collaborative Intelligence Index (X-CII) and provide proposed protocols for organizational simulation. Our simulated findings suggest potential improvements in collaborative outcomes, with illustrative Relative X-CII scores reaching up to ~150% of baseline performance, while assuming AUROC ≈ 0.70–0.85 for hallucination detection based on state-of-the-art methods (e.g., semantic entropy and MIND, per Nature 2024 and ACL 2024). This work bridges theoretical frameworks with simulated real-world application, offering conceptual insights for future hypothesis testing in human-AI collaboration.

## 1. Introduction

The landscape of human-AI collaboration has evolved rapidly since our initial theoretical framework publication [Torisan Unya [@torisan_unya], 2025a]. While our previous work established the foundational concepts of Enhanced Collaborative Effectiveness Index (E-CEI), three critical limitations emerged in conceptual analysis:

1. **Static Measurement Paradigm**: The original E-CEI framework relied on relatively static metrics that failed to capture the dynamic nature of evolving human-AI partnerships.
2. **Limited Domain Generalization**: Our theoretical model required simulated validation across diverse application domains to explore broader applicability.
3. **Implementation Gap**: The absence of practical implementation protocols hindered conceptual adoption of our collaborative framework.

This document addresses these limitations through simulation:
- Introduction of a simplified X-CII with dynamic mechanisms, informed by HAI Index (Friends of Europe 2025)[21] and Symbiotic AI evaluation (AI Asia Pacific 2025)[23]
- Hypothetical validation scenarios across four distinct domains
- Development of proposed implementation protocols for organizational simulation
- Analysis of illustrative long-term collaborative evolution patterns

Our extended framework represents a conceptual shift from measuring mere task effectiveness to capturing the emergence of genuine collaborative intelligence—a new form of cognitive capability that transcends individual human or AI performance in simulated scenarios, as evidenced by synergy metrics in Nature Human Behaviour 2024[14].

## 2. Literature Review

Existing works like Licklider (1960)[2] on man-computer symbiosis and Brynjolfsson & McAfee (2014)[3] on economic implications of human-machine collaboration provide foundational context. Recent empirical studies, such as Amershi et al. (2019)[4] on human-AI interaction guidelines and Bansal et al. (2019)[5] on mental models in team performance, emphasize trust and complementary expertise. To address gaps, we incorporate 2024-2025 findings: e.g., ChatGPT enhances creativity by 15% on average but can amplify fixation bias (Nature Human Behaviour 2024[14]; Science Advances 2025[15]); human-GenAI collaboration improves task performance but undermines long-term psychological growth (Scientific Reports, 2025[16]); synergies in co-creativity across levels (arXiv 2411.12527[17]); and cases where human-AI combinations underperform the best individual (MIT Sloan 2024[18]). These inform X-CII's synergy metrics, balancing enhancement with risks like bias fixation.

## 4. Extended Theoretical Framework

### 4.1 Evolution from E-CEI to X-CII

**Theoretical Evolution from Effectiveness to Intelligence:** The transition from "Effectiveness" to "Intelligence" in our metric nomenclature reflects a fundamental conceptual advancement. While E-CEI measured collaborative task effectiveness, X-CII captures the emergence of genuine **collaborative intelligence**—a new form of cognitive capability that transcends individual human or AI performance through synergistic integration, as quantified in HAI Index (Friends of Europe 2025)[21].

The simplified Extended Collaborative Intelligence Index (X-CII) incorporates dynamic mechanisms and domain-specific adaptations:

\[ \text{Core X-CII} = \left( Q' \times E' \times S' \right)^{1/3} \quad (0-1 \text{ scale}) \]

\[ \text{Relative X-CII (\%)} = 100 \times \frac{\text{Core X-CII}_{\text{collab}}}{\max(\text{Core X-CII}_{\text{human}}, \text{Core X-CII}_{\text{AI}})} \]

Where:
- **Q**: Quality (0-1 scale; verifiable outputs and expert evaluation, informed by PAI Framework, Medium 2025[22]; normalized via z-score to sigmoid for [0,1]; reference distribution for z-scoring is pre-registered (fixed benchmark set); we use a robust z (median/MAD [Median Absolute Deviation]) in sensitivity analyses)
- **E**: Efficiency (0-1 scale; normalized completion time and cost, per Nature Human Behaviour 2024[14]; E_time = (t_max - t)/(t_max - t_min) and E_cost = (c_max - c)/(c_max - c_min) to ensure lower time/cost yields higher score; min–max normalized on a pre-registered benchmark distribution (clipped to [0,1]); overall E is a weighted harmonic mean (default w_time=w_cost=0.5); if min=max (zero variance), set to 0.5 per pre-registered rule)
- **S**: Safety (0-1 scale; S = 1 - L_S, where L_S = min(1, w_FN·FN_rate + w_FP·FP_rate) at pre-registered threshold τ (default τ=0.5; w_FN=3, w_FP=1), incorporating semantic entropy-based hallucination detection (Nature 2024[6]); sensitivity analysis over w_FN ∈ [2,5] and τ ∈ {0.3,0.5,0.7}). S is clipped to [0,1].
Here, FN_rate and FP_rate are empirical estimators of P(hallucination ∧ unflagged) and P(non-hallucination ∧ flagged), computed over all predictions within the evaluation window at the pre-registered threshold τ; thus L_S defined via rates is a plug-in estimate of the probability-based loss in §8.3. The cross-reference to §8.3 highlights the probability-based foundation of L_S.
- Primed terms (Q', E', S') apply flooring at 0.01 (i.e., max(component, 0.01)) unless pre-registered otherwise, to stabilize geometric mean.
- Baseline comparators are measured on identical tasks, data, time/cost constraints, and scoring rubrics, pre-registered before simulation. No post-hoc re-weighting. If max(Core X-CII_human, Core X-CII_AI) < 0.05, we set the denominator to 0.05 and flag the case for diagnostic review. Effect sizes (Hedges’ g) compare the collaboration condition against the best single-agent baseline (max of human-only, AI-only) on identical tasks. Unless pre-registered otherwise, we macro-average Q/E/S across tasks (equal weights); micro-average (task count or time-weighted) reported in sensitivity analyses for robustness. We also report the absolute Core X-CII.

This formula simplifies previous versions for practicality, with components normalized to 0-1 scales to avoid unit inconsistency. It focuses on measurable components while maintaining synergy (emergent capabilities where Relative X-CII > 100%, with effect sizes reported (e.g., Hedges’ g; g ≈ 0.2 regarded as small but meaningful), including 95% CIs per Nature Human Behaviour 2024[14]). Trust is recalibrated using Brier score for behavioral calibration (Frontiers 2024[8]).

### 4.2 Multi-Domain Adaptation Framework

Our extended framework incorporates domain-specific coefficients derived from meta-analysis (e.g., effect sizes from arXiv 2407.19098[11]). The domain coefficients (Ds, Dc, Db, De) are priors used for simulation design and sensitivity analyses, not multipliers in the X-CII score. Primary reporting remains the unadjusted Relative X-CII (%):
- **Scientific Research (Ds)**: 1.10 (emphasizes accuracy and methodological rigor; per arXiv 2403.04931[12])
- **Creative Industries (Dc)**: 1.35 (amplifies innovation and originality, high variability; per Nature Human Behaviour 2024[14])
- **Business Strategy (Db)**: 1.05 (balances efficiency and risk management)
- **Education (De)**: 1.25 (prioritizes comprehension and knowledge transfer)

Adaptation includes symbiotic modes (e.g., complementary, supervisory) from arXiv 2407.19098[11] for dynamic adjustment.

### 4.3 Diagnostic Indicators (not part of X-CII)

AI Initiation Factor (AIF): Proportion of AI-initiated contributions (0-1). Role Balance Index (RBI) = 1 - 2|AIF - 0.5|.  
Team Cognition Overlap (TCO): Similarity of human-AI concept maps (e.g., cosine similarity via fixed embedding model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2, sentence-transformers v2.2.2, commit hash e1d6b2a), threshold 0.7 for alignment; heuristic value, with ablation in simulation showing sensitivity). We pre-register the embedder artifact (e.g., sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2, commit hash/sha256) and conduct sensitivity over similarity thresholds ∈ {0.6, 0.7, 0.8}.  
Dynamic Role Adaptation (DRA): Entropy change in role distributions and post-change Q/E/S deltas. These monitor X-CII causes for optimization.
To mitigate Goodhart's law (where metrics become targets and lose validity), incorporate periodic audit of non-X-CII metrics (e.g., sample review of unweighted Q/E/S) per pre-registered protocol.

## 5. Hypothetical Validation Simulation

### 5.1 Proposed Methodology

**Hypothetical Participants**: N = 200 (50 per domain)  
**Simulated Duration**: 12 months (calendar year; e.g., January-December 2025)  
**Domains**: Scientific Research, Creative Industries, Business Strategy, Education  
**Design**: Simulated randomized controlled trial with three conditions:
- Human-AI Collaboration (X-CII framework)
- Human-only control group
- AI-only control group
Crossover designs include washout periods (e.g., 1 simulated week) and block randomization at task level. Missing data are handled via multiple imputation (m=20) using MICE (van Buuren, 2018)[33], including Q/E/S, domain, condition, time, trust, and acceptance rate; complete-case analyses are reported as sensitivity.

Simulated via agent-based modeling, incorporating stochastic elements for realism (inspired by arXiv 2505.17500 Discovery Engine[25]). Variance estimated using Monte Carlo methods (1,000 replicates, seeded; Var ≈ 100 (pp^2), SD ≈ 10 pp for Relative X-CII). pp denotes percentage points. Incorporates crossover designs and yoked designs for causal identification. Pre-registration (e.g., on OSF/Zenodo) includes metrics (Q/E/S), τ, w_FN/w_FP, random seeds, stopping rules, and analysis plan. While simulations demonstrate conceptual trends, real-world validation is essential to address empirical gaps; future work includes pilot studies (e.g., N=20 actual human-AI tasks) for metric refinement.

### 5.2 Measurement Instruments

1. **Task Performance Metrics**: Completion time (minutes), error rate (%); domain-specific outcomes.
2. **X-CII Scoring**: Pseudo real-time assessment (batch updates, e.g., weekly) with psychometric validation (e.g., ICC ≥ 0.75 for Q inter-rater agreement, test-retest for E, ECE/AUROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve)/AUPRC (Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve) for S; diagnostic metrics (AUROC/AUPRC/ECE [Expected Calibration Error]) are reported for detectors; however, only thresholded expected loss contributes to S in X-CII). Quality is rated by k=3 blinded experts; we target ICC(2,k) ≥ 0.75 (Koo & Li, 2016)[34]. Raters complete two calibration rounds with a shared rubric; disagreements >1 point are adjudicated before deployment.
3. **Qualitative Assessments**: Thematic analysis of interviews (CHI 2024)[19]; User Satisfaction via 5-point Likert scale (JMIR 2024)[20].
4. **Longitudinal Tracking**: Monthly progress evaluations, including behavioral trust calibration via Brier score/Expected Calibration Error (ECE); subjective trust via Likert scales; acceptance rate (proportion of AI recommendations adopted) as supplementary (Frontiers 2024[8]).
Primary calibration: user-reported probability that the AI recommendation is correct/safe; Secondary: AI self-confidence. We compute and report Brier/ECE separately for both (with reliability intercept/slope).
Calibration intercept and slope are obtained via logistic recalibration: logit(y) ~ α + β·logit(p̂); we report α (ideal≈0) and β (ideal≈1) alongside Brier/ECE.
Primary endpoint: Relative X-CII; Secondary endpoints: individual Q/E/S, calibration metrics, fairness (EO diff, stratified AUROC/AUPRC).

### 5.3 Illustrative Results by Domain

The following table presents simulated results, with X-CII scores reflecting the Relative X-CII (baseline=100%). We report mean [95% CI]; effect sizes (Hedges’ g [95% CI]) indicate small but meaningful improvements (g ≈ 0.2-0.4). CIs are over Monte Carlo replicates, not participant-level uncertainty.

| Domain              | Simulated Relative X-CII (%) (estimate) | Performance Improvement | Other Metrics | Hedges’ g [95% CI] |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------|---------------------|
| Scientific Research | ~150 [140-160]                    | 50-60% relative gains vs. best single-agent baseline | 20% time reduction | 0.35 [0.20-0.50] |
| Creative Industries | ~145 [135-155]                    | 55-65% relative gains vs. best single-agent baseline (originality rated on 7-point scale) | 80% satisfaction | 0.40 [0.25-0.55] |
| Business Strategy   | ~140 [130-150]                    | 60-70% relative gains vs. best single-agent baseline (accuracy) | 30% faster decisions | 0.30 [0.15-0.45] |
| Education           | ~155 [145-165]                    | 50-60% relative gains vs. best single-agent baseline (standardized test scores) | 3x personalization (simulated estimate; unique learning paths ratio) | 0.45 [0.30-0.60] |

### 5.4 Cross-Domain Analysis

**Key Simulated Findings**:
1. **Consistent Superiority**: Human-AI collaboration outperformed controls across domains.
2. **Learning Curve**: Relative X-CII improved 20-28% [15-33%] over 12 months (relative % increase from Month 1 baseline; growth curve modeling, β from simulation, per arXiv 2407.19098[11]).
Growth-curve specification: mixed-effects model ln(Relative X-CII_it/100) = β0 + β1·t + u_i + ε_it, where t is months since start and u_i is a team random intercept; β1 is reported as monthly relative % change.
We report exp(β1)−1 as the monthly relative change (%).
3. **Domain Variance**: Creative industries highest variability; scientific research most consistent (p-values from simulated data, hypothetical ANOVA <0.01).
4. **Threshold Effect**: Optimal collaboration after 5 weeks (arXiv 2407.19098[11]).
Hierarchical modeling for repeated measures, with cluster-robust SEs for effect sizes.

We report hallucination prevalence, stratified AUROC/AUPRC, and calibration (ECE, Brier, intercept/slope) on a hand-labeled, stratified holdout. We control the false discovery rate (Benjamini–Hochberg) for cross-domain and longitudinal tests. We set the Benjamini–Hochberg FDR at q=0.05 unless otherwise pre-registered.

## 6. Proposed Implementation Framework for Simulation

### 6.1 Organizational Adoption Protocol Template

#### Phase 1: Assessment and Preparation (Weeks 1-4)
- Baseline measurement using decision tree from arXiv 2407.19098[11].
- Domain mapping and team selection.
- X-CII integration.

#### Phase 2: Pilot Implementation (Weeks 5-16)

#### Phase 3: Scale and Expansion (Weeks 17-32)
- Broader deployment with ROI: (Time_savings + Rework_reduction + Risk_reduction + Revenue_uplift - Total_cost) / Total_cost, where savings monetize E/Q/S gains (e.g., E improvement as labor cost equivalent; Rework_reduction via Q-based rework frequency x impact; Risk_reduction as expected loss avoidance over 12 months, frequency x severity). Each benefit is mapped to exactly one bucket (time, rework, risk, revenue) per a pre-registered taxonomy to avoid double counting.
We report one-way sensitivity analyses on unit costs, time rates, and risk severity/frequency at ±20% to assess ROI robustness.
- Best practice documentation.

2. **Under-reliance on AI**: trust level <50% → under-adoption of beneficial suggestions, poor outcomes in first 5 weeks.

**Recovery Strategies**:
- Rebalancing via trust level recalibration (Frontiers 2024[8]).
- Extended onboarding.

## 8. Ethical Considerations and Risk Management in Simulation

### 8.1 Advanced Bias Mitigation

**Multi-layered Bias Assessment**:
- Algorithmic detection (Fairlearn).
- Diverse integration (ScienceDirect 2025)[26].
Report group-stratified AUROC/AUPRC, Equalized Odds differences (EO diff) with 95% CI (estimated via bootstrap or hierarchical Bayesian posterior intervals), pre-registered (EU AI Act 2024 compliance).
For small-sample strata (n<20 flagged and not used for KPIs; report with wide CIs via hierarchical partial pooling), apply hierarchical Bayesian partial pooling to mitigate over-dispersion and unstable estimates (bioRxiv 2025[32]).

### 8.2 Human Agency and Autonomy

**Mechanisms**:
- Human override.
- Explainability.

### 8.3 AI Safety and Reliability

**Hallucination Detection**:
- Performance via AUROC/AUPRC and precision/recall; Define L_S = w_FN·P(hallucination ∧ unflagged) + w_FP·P(non-hallucination ∧ flagged) estimated over tasks at pre-registered τ; default w_FN ≥ w_FP reflecting asymmetric harm (semantic entropy Nature 2024[6]; MIND ACL 2024[7]). S = 1 - L_S.
We separately report detector AUROC/AUPRC under distribution shift (e.g., time, domain, difficulty shifts), when applicable.
- Human+multi-AI verification.

### 8.4 Societal Impact

**Implications**:
- Partnership focus, aligned with regulations like EU AI Act (2024) for high-risk systems, ensuring equitable access and preventing monopolization (AIQ arXiv 2503.16438[10]).

## Appendix A: Agent-Based Model Specification

- **Human Agent**: Decision-making via acceptance rate update (logistic regression on past outcomes; p_t = σ(θ0 + θ1·past_success_rate + θ2·explainability_score)).
explainability_score ~ U(0,1), or monotonic function of model quality (e.g., sigmoid of AI accuracy rate).
- **AI Agent**: Error generation from Beta distribution (α=2, β=8): for each task, sample error probability e_t ~ Beta(2,8), then outcome y_t ~ Bernoulli(e_t).
- **Task Difficulty**: Lognormal distribution (μ=0, σ=0.6).
- **Noise**: Gaussian perturbation on Q/E/S (mean=0, sd=0.05).
- **Update Rules**: Trust update = previous + δ * (outcome - expected); δ = 0.1.
- **Initial Values**: Trust ~ Beta(3,3); seed=42 (and variants for replicates).
Sensitivity: Vary Q/E/S weights (equal vs. stakeholder-weighted) in Monte Carlo replicates to assess X-CII robustness.
Power analysis (for future real-world validation): For Hedges’ g=0.30, α=0.05, 1-β=0.8, estimated N≈88 per arm (two-sided t-test, clustered design adjustment).
Rates: FN_rate = FN / N_pos and FP_rate = FP / N_neg, where N_pos counts hallucination-eligible instances and N_neg non-hallucination instances at threshold τ; rates are aggregated across tasks within a domain unless otherwise pre-registered.
Micro-average Q = sum(Q_i * w_i) / sum(w_i), where w_i is task count or time (reported in sensitivity analyses). Micro-averaging for E and S is defined analogously to Q using time or task-count weights, reported in sensitivity analyses.
Example X-CII Calculation: For Q=0.80, E=0.70, S=0.90, Core X-CII=(0.8×0.7×0.9)^(1/3)≈0.79. If baselines are human=0.65, AI=0.60, Relative X-CII=100×0.79/0.65≈121.5%.
