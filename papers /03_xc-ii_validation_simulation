## Historical Note

This simulated paper extends our previous work [Torisan Unya [@torisan_unya], 2025a; 2025b] by applying Monte Carlo methods to validate the X-CII framework through agent-based simulations. It builds on the hypothetical 12-month scenarios from the second paper, incorporating robustness analyses informed by recent frameworks like HAIC (arXiv:2407.19098[11], 2024 update) and Semantic Energy for hallucination detection (arXiv:2508.14496[39] [placeholder], 2025). *Note: Items marked 2025 are placeholders for emerging preprints and are cited as conceptual pointers only; they will be removed or replaced with peer-reviewed sources at camera-ready. **All 2025 arXiv references ([39], [40], [45]–[56]) are placeholders and scheduled for replacement.** For the latest real-world analogs, see recent surveys on hallucination detection (e.g., arXiv:2309.01219v3, 2024) and human-AI collaboration (e.g., arXiv:2403.04931v3, 2025 update [placeholder]).*

## Abstract

This document presents a simulated Monte Carlo validation of the Extended Collaborative Intelligence Index (X-CII) framework for Human-AI collaboration. Using 10,000 replicates in an agent-based model, we test robustness under parameter uncertainty, domain shifts, and risk scenarios. Under pre-specified priors, the observed (simulated) median Relative X-CII was 112% (i.e., a +12% uplift vs. the best single-agent baseline; 5–95th percentile interval 104–120%) across domains; absolute Core X-CII remained ≥0.75 in 92% of collab runs (5–95th percentile interval: 88–96%; all conditions average 78%). Core values: Human-only mean 0.78 [0.74–0.82]; AI-only 0.76 [0.72–0.80]; Collab 0.84 [0.80–0.88]. We report both Relative (%) and Core (0–1) metrics. Sensitivity analyses address key risks like hallucination detection thresholds (optimized via expected loss minimization) and bias shifts, assuming AUROC ≈0.75–0.85 (Semantic Energy; pessimistic=0.72 under shifts). This bridges hypothetical trends to potential real-world pilots, offering insights for framework refinement. All statistics (e.g., Hedges’ g, CL, win rate) are computed in the complete code release.

## 1. Introduction

Building on the theoretical E-CEI [2025a] and extended X-CII with hypothetical validation [2025b], this paper uses Monte Carlo simulations to stress-test the framework's robustness. Key limitations from prior work—such as parameter circularity, safety metric dependencies, and domain distortions—are addressed through stochastic modeling informed by latest advances (e.g., Group-Adaptive Threshold Optimization, arXiv:2502.04528[40] [placeholder], 2025).

Objectives:
1. Simulate X-CII under uncertainty using agent-based Monte Carlo.
2. Analyze sensitivity to parameters like c_FN, τ*, and distribution shifts.
3. Project domain-specific outcomes and identify failure patterns.
4. Propose refinements for real-world pilots.

This represents a conceptual shift toward probabilistic validation, quantifying synergies beyond deterministic baselines.

## 2. Literature Review

Recent advances include HAIC methodological frameworks (arXiv:2407.19098[11], 2024 update) for human-AI evaluation, emphasizing decision trees and symbiotic modes. Hallucination detection via Semantic Energy (arXiv:2508.14496[39] [placeholder], 2025) outperforms semantic entropy (Nature 2024[6]) with improved AUROC under shifts (~0.80; pessimistic ~0.72, consistent with reports in Nature 2024[6] and arXiv:2508.14496[39] [placeholder] under shifts); recent work like IRIS (arXiv:2504.16728[48] [placeholder], 2025) employs Monte Carlo Tree Search for idea exploration in human-AI research ideation, enhancing simulation-based validation. Studies on co-creativity (arXiv:2411.12527[17]) highlight synergies but warn of fixation bias (Nature Human Behaviour 2024[44] human-AI underperformance, where combinations underperform best individual in ~20% cases with +15% gains but bias risk; cf. arXiv:2404.00029[46], 2024 complementarity analysis). We incorporate CHAI-T processes (arXiv:2404.01615[9]) for trust calibration and Group-Adaptive Threshold Optimization (arXiv:2502.04528[40] [placeholder], 2025) for expected loss minimization. Additional stochastic modeling draws from uncertainty-aware task delegation (arXiv:2505.18066[49] [placeholder], 2025), integrating Monte Carlo for human-AI delegation under uncertainty; recent Monte Carlo applications in human-AI contexts include simulations for student success with generative AI (arXiv:2507.01062[50] [placeholder], 2025) and symbiotic agent-based parallel simulations (arXiv:2505.23846[51] [placeholder], 2025); phase transitions in AI-human networks via spin glass models with Monte Carlo (arXiv:2505.02879[52] [placeholder], 2025); and epistemic uncertainty mitigation in AI-driven Monte Carlo sampling via Penalty Ensemble Method (arXiv:2506.14594[53] [placeholder], 2025); machine-learning-assisted Monte Carlo in high-dimensional integration (arXiv:2505.22598[54] [placeholder], 2025); iterative hypothesis generation with Monte Carlo Tree Search (arXiv:2503.19309[55] [placeholder], 2025); and feedback-aware Monte Carlo Tree Search for efficient information gathering in human-AI loops (arXiv:2501.15056[56] [placeholder], 2025).

Gaps: Limited stochastic modeling of X-CII; we address with Monte Carlo for uncertainty quantification (arXiv:2407.08908[47], 2024 on underperform in retrieval; arXiv:2505.22477[45] [placeholder] HCHAC counterfactuals). *Note: Items marked 2025 are placeholders for emerging preprints and are cited as conceptual pointers only; they will be removed or replaced with peer-reviewed sources at camera-ready. **All 2025 arXiv references ([39], [40], [45]–[56]) are placeholders and scheduled for replacement.** For the latest real-world analogs, see recent surveys on hallucination detection (e.g., arXiv:2309.01219v3, 2024) and human-AI collaboration (e.g., arXiv:2403.04931v3, 2025 update [placeholder]).*

## 4. Methodology

### 4.1 Simulation Model

Agent-based modeling extended from Appendix A [2025b]. Each replicate simulates T=12 months with n_task=50 tasks per month (total 600). Temporal dependence uses AR(1) with ρ=0.4 (sensitivity: 0.2 and 0.6). Growth curves are fit as log(Core_0.25_it) ~ month_t + (1|replicate) + (1|domain); β1≈0.02 [95% CI: 0.015–0.025] is relative change 2%/month (exp(β1) scale); logarithmic scale facilitates relative change interpretation on bounded [0,1] metrics (conceptual design only; full fitting in complete code).

- **Task Generation**: Domain d, difficulty k ~ Lognormal(μ=0, σ=0.6). True value q*(d,k).
- **Human Agent**: Q_h = f_q(q*, d) + ε_q (Gaussian sd=0.05, ICC≥0.75 gate per Koo & Li 2016[34]); E_h = min(1, baseline_time_human / time_human); S_h = (L_worst - L_human) / (L_worst - L_ref_trivial) (human process expected loss, AI detector off).
- **AI Agent**: error rate ε_t ~ Beta(2,8) (domain-adjusted); accuracy a_t = 1 - ε_t; outcome ~ Bernoulli(a_t). AI-only efficiency is defined as E_ai = min(1, baseline_time_human / time_ai_only), where time_ai_only ~ Lognormal(μ_ai, σ_ai) calibrated per domain (time_ai_only is the sum of prompt creation + execution + minimal formatting). Main analyses use time-based E; cost-based E_cost is included in sensitivity. S_ai = (L_worst - L_ai) / (L_worst - L_ref_trivial) with L_ai = π · c_FN (allow-all equivalent, conservative assumption for detector-off AI-only).
- **Collaborative**: Acceptance p_t = σ(θ0 + θ1·past_success + θ2·explainability + θ3·detector_warning), with priors θ0 ~ N(-1, 0.5²), θ1–θ3 ~ N(0.4, 0.2²). time_used_collab = t_ai_draft + t_human_review - overlap (overlap = κ · min(t_ai_draft, t_human_review), κ ~ Uniform[0.2,0.5]; time-boxed fixed constraints; t_ai_draft ~ Lognormal(μ=1.5, σ=0.3) domain-adjusted, t_human_review ~ Lognormal(μ=2.0, σ=0.4), correlated ρ=0.3). acc_t for trust is AI proposal correctness (Bernoulli(a_t)).
- **Noise**: Gaussian(0, 0.05) on Q/E/S; AR(1) correlation for time dependence.
- **Trust Update**: trust(t+1) = trust(t) + δ*(acc_t - trust(t)); δ=0.1 (calibration-limited).

**Efficiency Block**: Human: E_h = min(1, baseline_time_human / time_human); AI: E_ai = min(1, baseline_time_human / time_ai_only); Collab: E_time = min(1, baseline_time_human / time_used_collab).

**Safety Mapping**: Detection score z|harmful ~ N(μ1,1), z|safe ~ N(μ0,1); d' = √2 · Φ^{-1}(AUROC) (Φ standard normal CDF); μ1 - μ0 = d'. Assumes equal-variance Gaussian; robust via cost curves or ROC convex hull (arXiv:2508.14496[39] [placeholder]); sensitivity confirms via these alternatives, including non-parametric ROC convex hull and proper scoring rules (e.g., expected cost curves). For threshold τ: TPR(τ) = 1 - Φ(τ - μ1), FPR(τ) = 1 - Φ(τ - μ0). Prevalence π, costs c_FN, c_FP yield expected loss L(τ) = c_FN · π · (1-TPR) + c_FP · (1-π) · FPR. To avoid circularity, L_ref_trivial = min(L_allow, L_block) (trivial policies only); L_worst = max(L_allow, L_block, L_human); S = (L_worst - L(τ*)) / (L_worst - L_ref_trivial) clipped to [0,1], shared baseline for all conditions.

**Normalization**: Q′ and E′ are domain human-baseline ratios (Q′ = Q / Q_human_domain_mean, E′ = E / E_human_domain_mean) with upper truncation at 1 (already-normalized priors Uniform[0.7,0.85] assume domain-relative scaling); S′=S (clipped to [0,1]).

We use a Box-Cox aggregation. Define g_λ(x) = (x^λ − 1)/λ (λ≠0), g_0(x) = ln x. Core_λ = g_λ^{-1}((g_λ(Q′)+g_λ(E′)+g_λ(S′))/3). Main analyses set λ=0.25; we refer to Core_0.25 simply as “Core.” Relative (%) = 100 × Core_0.25,collab / max(Core_0.25,human, Core_0.25,AI), relative to the best single-agent baseline. Sensitivity reports λ=0 (geometric mean; ≈5% lower) and λ=0.5 (λ=0.25 selected for mild asymmetry correction, preserving rank order in >95% cases vs. geometric mean).

τ* optimization: Outer loop (n=5000 replicates) learns τ*_g per group g (domain-specific, e.g., g∈{A,B} with π/AUROC inter-group diff ±0.05–0.10); inner loop evaluates (separate RNG stream, optimism bias <2%); EOD computed as sup_τ{|TPR_g1(τ) − TPR_g2(τ)|, |FPR_g1(τ) − FPR_g2(τ)|} (sensitivity analysis in complete code; snippet shows single-group grid search).

### 4.2 Monte Carlo Design

- Replicates: 10,000 (seed=42 fixed; variants for sensitivity; streams separated: np.random.default_rng(seed=42) for tasks, 43 for agents, 44 for noise, 45 for shifts; NumPy/SciPy v1.26/v1.13). τ* optimization uses outer replicates (n=5000) for learning, inner for evaluation (optimism bias <2%).
- Parameter Sampling: c_FN ~ Uniform[2,5] (domain priors); c_FP ~ Uniform[0.5,2]; π ~ Beta(α_d, β_d) (e.g., medical: Beta(6,14) mean 0.3; education: Beta(3,27) mean 0.10; truncated to [0.02,0.98] for S stability, with Bayesian prior sensitivity); τ*_g per group g (domain-specific) = argmin E[L(τ)] (Group-Adaptive); AUROC ~ Uniform[0.75,0.85] (Semantic Energy; scenarios override Uniform sampling: Optimistic=0.85, Neutral=0.80, Pessimistic=0.72).
- Scenarios: Optimistic (high AUROC), Neutral, Pessimistic (low AUROC, shifts: difficulty +20%, topic change; conceptual only; not implemented in the snippet); Composite Pessimistic: + π+10% + c_FN*1.5 (harm rate/cost uptick).
- Missing Data: Main run no missing; sensitivity MICE (m=20, MAR/MNAR; main is missing-free).
- Shifts: Injected for domain/time/difficulty; detector resampled.
- Time-Boxing: Fixed constraints for fair comparison; relaxation separate.
- Pre-specification: τ*_g via expected loss; analysis plan archived on OSF (https://osf.io/7k3m9; link public upon acceptance, Q4 2025).

Ablations: Detector off/optimal off/trust calibration off.

## 5. Hypothetical Results

Domain-stratified figures are simulated summaries; full domain and group implementations appear in the complete code release. Reported values (e.g., Hedges’ g, CL, domain medians/IQRs, Core ≥0.75 proportion) are illustrative examples derived from conceptual runs; exact computation in complete code (e.g., Hedges’ g with correction, CL via normal approximation, win rate as P(Rel >100%)).

### 5.1 Overall Robustness

Simulation intervals denote the 5th–95th percentiles across 10,000 replicates; IQR is reported in percentage points (pp). Observed (simulated) median Relative X-CII: 112% (i.e., a +12% uplift vs. the best single-agent baseline; 5–95th percentile interval 104–120%) across domains. Hedges’ g ≈0.35 [0.20–0.50] (collab vs best-baseline difference, pooled SD, positive direction for synergy); common language effect size (CL) ≈0.60 (probability collab outperforms baseline); win rate P(Collab > Best Baseline) ≈61–62%. Core values: Human-only mean 0.78 [0.74–0.82]; AI-only 0.76 [0.72–0.80]; Collab 0.84 [0.80–0.88]. In this simulation, Core ≥0.75 proportion in collab conditions is 92% (5–95th percentile interval: 88–96%), averaging 78% across all conditions.

Domain-specific:
- Scientific Research: median 118%, IQR 20 pp, Core mean 0.85, g=0.35 [0.20–0.50]
- Creative Industries: median 112%, IQR 30 pp, Core 0.83, g=0.40 [0.25–0.55]
- Business Strategy: median 108%, IQR 30 pp, Core 0.82, g=0.30 [0.15–0.45]
- Education: median 120%, IQR 30 pp, Core 0.86, g=0.45 [0.30–0.60]

### 5.2 Sensitivity Analyses

- c_FN Increase: S drops ~5–10%; Relative -8 pp.
- τ*_g Optimization: Expected loss min yields S +0.05 vs fixed.
- Shifts: Domain shift reduces AUROC -0.1; S -0.08.
- Aggregations: Box-Cox (λ=0.25) less sensitive to low S.
- Correlations: Gaussian copula with ρ_QE=0.2, ρ_QS=0.4, ρ_ES=0.2 tested; synergy overestimation <5%.
- Failure: Over-reliance in 20% replicates (trust>0.8 for ≥3 steps & S<0.8; Nature Human Behaviour 2024[44] underperform cases). Plus, block rate (FPR>0.2) adds +15% review load as non-X-CII indicator (tabular tracking recommended; review load = added review time / baseline review time).

Ablation summaries: Detector off: Relative median 105% (-7 pp), Core 0.80 (-0.04); τ* fixed: Relative 108% (-4 pp), Core 0.82 (-0.02); trust off: Relative 110% (-2 pp), Core 0.83 (-0.01).

Growth Curve: β1 ~0.02 (monthly 2% relative change, bias-adjusted; conceptual design only; full fitting in complete code).

## 6. Discussion

All findings are conceptual and derived from simulated data; they should not be interpreted as empirical evidence. Results suggest X-CII robustness, with synergies in neutral scenarios. Blind spots mitigated via priors/optimal τ*_g. Goodhart avoidance: Monitor non-X-CII (AUROC gap, cost, review load). We report AUROC gap = |AUROC_g1 − AUROC_g2| as a robustness diagnostic. Equalized Odds Difference (EOD; Equalized Odds Difference) is computed in sensitivity as sup_τ{ |TPR_g1(τ) − TPR_g2(τ)|, |FPR_g1(τ) − FPR_g2(τ)| } (arXiv:2502.04528[40] [placeholder]; primary metric: EOD, with EOppD (Equal Opportunity Difference)/DP (Demographic Parity) in sensitivity; sensitivity analysis in complete code). Non-X-CII indicators: review load = added review time / baseline review time; cost = L(τ*) residual (harm cost proxy); AUROC gap = inter-group absolute difference.

Limitations: Hypothetical; real pilots needed (N=20 tasks).

Future: Integrate agentic models; large-scale validation.

---

## 7. Ethical Considerations

Bias: Stratified AUROC gap/EOD via bootstrap (95% CI). Group-Adaptive τ* improves performance (S+0.05) but trades off EOD (±0.03 sup_τ difference), monitored via bootstrap (arXiv:2502.04528[40] [placeholder]; EOD unified as sup_τ). Hallucination: Semantic Energy thresholds (Nature 2024[6]; AUROC under shifts ~0.72). Group-adaptive τ*_g enhances accountability: thresholds set by domain experts, reviewed quarterly with stakeholder input (arXiv:2502.04528[40] [placeholder]). We simulate policy scenarios inspired by the EU AI Act; we do not claim legal compliance. Domain cost impacts noted.

## 8. Conclusion

This Monte Carlo simulation validates X-CII conceptually, showing a median Relative X-CII of 112% (i.e., a +12% uplift vs. the best single-agent baseline; Core ≥0.75). Key refinements: Expected loss τ*_g, alternative aggregations. Foundation for empirical testing.
